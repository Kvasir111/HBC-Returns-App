# HBC-Equipment-Return

> A Nuxt Refactoring of the HBC equipment return Vue app

## What the hell is this?
This is my attempt to remove paper hand receipts from HBCI offices. 

The webpage will take in customer information and the equipment to be returned then send that information off to firebase to keep record. It then locally makes a PDF with jsPDF and allows the user to print that if needed.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
